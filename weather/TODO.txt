Pro vs Free version of the app looks like.

I probably need some kind of config that decides if Current user is Pro or Free. and then based it we give / remove features.

I'll describe some of the Pro vs Free features.

Pro = everyting that is in the app right now

All

Better Mobile 

Free

1 - remove the Toggle Extra Days button and we always show lowlight days with class "lowlightHide"

2 - do not show maximum number of days in the table, limit to 7 days at most

3 - limit adding 3 rows of Cities at most. only Pro can have unlimited cities

4 - only Pro is allowed to add the TO and FROM dates. and if any data is stored, show days without from/to dates styles


PRO

* add trips, save trips
* login to Google, save data there
* export screenshot
* view just my travel days, not upcoming or trailing
* Timezone and Elevation to Pro

FREE

* Consider ADS for the cities where they are traveling?!





************
*** DONE ***
************


ALL

* Add header bar with app name and Avatar and ADD button 
* 2 share buttons
** share app
** share this config
* move ADD to a popup
